# Customer Insights Dashboard using Dash, K-Means, and Random Forest


This project is an interactive dashboard for analyzing customer data from a Marketing Campaign dataset. 

It leverages Dash for web-based visualizations and scikit-learn for clustering and classification using the K-Means and Random Forest algorithms.



# 📋 Project Overview


- This dashboard provides insights into customer behaviors, income distribution, spending patterns, and segmentation.
- It allows users to interactively explore data by filtering education levels and marital status and visualize results dynamically through various charts and graphs.



# 🚀 Features


- Income Distribution & Customer Count by Marital Status
- Spending Analysis by Product Category
- Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
- Classification using Random Forest Model
- Interactive filters to explore the data based on education and marital status.


# 🛠️ Technologies Used


- Dash: For creating interactive dashboards.

- Plotly Express: For generating graphs and visualizations.

- scikit-learn: For K-Means clustering and Random Forest classification.

- Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For advanced visualizations (e.g., confusion matrices).



# 📊 Dataset

- The project uses the marketing_campaign.csv dataset, which contains information such as:

- Income, Marital Status, Education

- Spending on various products (e.g., Wines, Fruits, Meat)

- Segmentation features for clustering and classification.



# 🖼️ Project Layout

- Left Panel: Filters for education and marital status.

- Right Panel: Graphs including:

- Income Distribution

- Customer Count by Marital Status

- K-Means Clustering Results

- Random Forest Confusion Matrix & Feature Importance

- Total Spending Breakdown by Category



# 📈 Algorithms Used

- K-Means Clustering: Groups customers based on their income and spending behavior.

- Random Forest Classifier: Classifies customers by marital status based on income and spending habits.



# 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.9.6

- Dash 2.18.1

- Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn



# 📥 How to Use

- Adjust filters (education and marital status) to explore customer segments.

- The graphs will update dynamically based on the selected filters.

- Explore clustering and classification results through the dashboard.


# 🎯 Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to derive meaningful insights from customer data and demonstrate the use of K-Means clustering and Random Forest algorithms within a data visualization dashboard.
