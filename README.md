# Customer Insights Dashboard using Dash, K-Means, and Random Forest


<br>

# Project Overview

- This dashboard provides insights into customer behaviors, income distribution, spending patterns, and segmentation.
- It allows users to interactively explore data by filtering education levels and marital status and visualize results dynamically through various charts and graphs.


<br>

# Features

- Income Distribution & Customer Count by Marital Status
- Spending Analysis by Product Category
- Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
- Classification using Random Forest Model
- Interactive filters to explore the data based on education and marital status.

<br>

# Technologies Used

- Dash: For creating interactive dashboards.

- Plotly Express: For generating graphs and visualizations.

- scikit-learn: For K-Means clustering and Random Forest classification.

- Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For advanced visualizations (e.g., confusion matrices).

<br>

# Dataset

The project uses the marketing_campaign.csv dataset, which contains information such as:

- Income, Marital Status, Education

- Spending on various products (e.g., Wines, Fruits, Meat)

- Segmentation features for clustering and classification.

<br>

# Algorithms Used

- K-Means Clustering: Groups customers based on their income and spending behavior.

- Random Forest Classifier: Classifies customers by marital status based on income and spending habits.

<br>

# Requirements

- Python 3.9.6

- Dash 2.18.1

- Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

<br>

# How to Use

- Adjust filters (education and marital status) to explore customer segments.

- The graphs will update dynamically based on the selected filters.

- Explore clustering and classification results through the dashboard.

<br>

# Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to derive meaningful insights from customer data and demonstrate the use of K-Means clustering and Random Forest algorithms within a data visualization dashboard.
